&nbsp;  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION



&nbsp;  1. Definitions.



&nbsp;     "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,

&nbsp;     and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.



&nbsp;     "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by

&nbsp;     the copyright owner that is granting the License.



&nbsp;     "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all

&nbsp;     other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common

&nbsp;     control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

&nbsp;     "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the

&nbsp;     direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or

&nbsp;     otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

&nbsp;     outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.



&nbsp;     "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity

&nbsp;     exercising permissions granted by this License.



&nbsp;     "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,

&nbsp;     including but not limited to software source code, documentation

&nbsp;     source, and configuration files.



&nbsp;     "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical

&nbsp;     transformation or translation of a Source form, including but

&nbsp;     not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,

&nbsp;     and conversions to other media types.



&nbsp;     "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or

&nbsp;     Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a

&nbsp;     copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work

&nbsp;     (an example is provided in the Appendix below).



&nbsp;     "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object

&nbsp;     form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

&nbsp;     editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

&nbsp;     represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes

&nbsp;     of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

&nbsp;     separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,

&nbsp;     the Work and Derivative Works thereof.



&nbsp;     "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

&nbsp;     the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

&nbsp;     to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

&nbsp;     submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner

&nbsp;     or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of

&nbsp;     the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

&nbsp;     means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

&nbsp;     to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

&nbsp;     communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

&nbsp;     and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the

&nbsp;     Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but

&nbsp;     excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise

&nbsp;     designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."



&nbsp;     "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

&nbsp;     on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

&nbsp;     subsequently incorporated within the Work.



&nbsp;  2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

&nbsp;     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

&nbsp;     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

&nbsp;     copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

&nbsp;     publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

&nbsp;     Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.



&nbsp;  3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

&nbsp;     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

&nbsp;     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

&nbsp;     (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

&nbsp;     use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

&nbsp;     where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable

&nbsp;     by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their

&nbsp;     Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

&nbsp;     with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You

&nbsp;     institute patent litigation against any entity (including a

&nbsp;     cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work

&nbsp;     or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct

&nbsp;     or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses

&nbsp;     granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate

&nbsp;     as of the date such litigation is filed.



&nbsp;  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

&nbsp;     Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without

&nbsp;     modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

&nbsp;     meet the following conditions:



&nbsp;     (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or

&nbsp;         Derivative Works a copy of this License; and



&nbsp;     (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices

&nbsp;         stating that You changed the files; and



&nbsp;     (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

&nbsp;         that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and

&nbsp;         attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,

&nbsp;         excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of

&nbsp;         the Derivative Works; and



&nbsp;     (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its

&nbsp;         distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

&nbsp;         include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained

&nbsp;         within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not

&nbsp;         pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one

&nbsp;         of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed

&nbsp;         as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

&nbsp;         documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,

&nbsp;         within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and

&nbsp;         wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents

&nbsp;         of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

&nbsp;         do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution

&nbsp;         notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

&nbsp;         or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided

&nbsp;         that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

&nbsp;         as modifying the License.



&nbsp;     You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and

&nbsp;     may provide additional or different license terms and conditions

&nbsp;     for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

&nbsp;     for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

&nbsp;     reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with

&nbsp;     the conditions stated in this License.



&nbsp;  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,

&nbsp;     any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

&nbsp;     by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of

&nbsp;     this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

&nbsp;     Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify

&nbsp;     the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed

&nbsp;     with Licensor regarding such Contributions.



&nbsp;  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

&nbsp;     names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

&nbsp;     except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the

&nbsp;     origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.



&nbsp;  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or

&nbsp;     agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each

&nbsp;     Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

&nbsp;     WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or

&nbsp;     implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions

&nbsp;     of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

&nbsp;     PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

&nbsp;     appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any

&nbsp;     risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.



&nbsp;  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,

&nbsp;     whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,

&nbsp;     unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly

&nbsp;     negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be

&nbsp;     liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,

&nbsp;     incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a

&nbsp;     result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

&nbsp;     Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,

&nbsp;     work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all

&nbsp;     other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor

&nbsp;     has been advised of the possibility of such damages.



&nbsp;  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing

&nbsp;     the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

&nbsp;     and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,

&nbsp;     or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

&nbsp;     License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only

&nbsp;     on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf

&nbsp;     of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,

&nbsp;     defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability

&nbsp;     incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason

&nbsp;     of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
